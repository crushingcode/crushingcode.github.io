## Abstract

If you've been developing Android applications for a while now, you know the pain of handling the lifecycle just right. Itâ€™s a pain-point that has existed since the advent of Android, up until recently when Google released Architecture components. As an Android developer you are bugged by handling activity/fragment lifecycle and flow of data in tandem to the lifecycle changes day in and out. Making your code aware about the lifecycle of the process/activity/fragment makes you more confident as a developer and enables faster development. This session would enable you to understand Lifecycle components (ProcessLifecycleOwner, LifecycleOwner, LifecycleObserver) and how they are leveraged in other architecture components like LiveData and ViewModel.
