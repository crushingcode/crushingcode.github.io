## Abstract

Kotlin Coroutines graduated to stable release just last year and are fairly new for everyone adopting them. That means a lot of the information is not quite straightforward when it comes to implementing them in current projects. In this talk, you will be cooking up a hot pot of various Kotlin Coroutine approaches. You will be covering some aromatic recipes that provide step by step process to add that specific flavor to your current Kotlin and/or Android projects to unlock the full potential of Coroutines.
