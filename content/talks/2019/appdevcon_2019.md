## Abstract

Building an Android library in the current times is way different than what it used to be earlier. Things have changed considerably and keeping up to date with them is now a necessity rather than just some acquirable knowledge.

In this session, you will dive deeper into best practices and ways of architecting Android libraries. You will get to learn about the common pitfalls and how to overcome them by using the right approach such as leveraging architecture components and making your Android libraries lifecycle-aware. You will also understand how one can leverage Kotlin language when developing Android libraries as well as information around API design and exploring the path to becoming a better Android Library Developer.
By the end of this session, you will be all set to build Android libraries that scale and have API which contributes to the developer's happiness.
