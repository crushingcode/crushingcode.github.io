## Abstract

A lot of Android libraries are being built/shipped by indie devs and companies alike. Everyone wants to start working inside the host application as quickly as possible. This competition has led to many of these Android libraries to implement various possible hack/tricks in order to get up and running inside host Android application as quickly as possible. Eventually leading to bad side effects introduced on the host application side.

In this session, you will get to learn about the various ways Android Library developers use to init their code inside the host application. You will also get to understand how these mechanisms work, what pitfalls they bring and where are these employed within an existing Android application. Towards the end of this session, the new and shiny Jetpack Startup AndroidX library will be introduced along with information on how to use it and what it brings to the table to solve the startup mess the Android Library ecosystem is in currently.

By the end of this session, you will be all set to build Android libraries that scale and have API which doesn't mess up with the startup of your Android application.
