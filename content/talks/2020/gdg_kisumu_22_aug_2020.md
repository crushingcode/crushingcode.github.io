## Abstract

Enabling an enhanced audio experience for your users is the topmost priority for developers who build audio processing apps. Android, however, holds dark secrets about low latency audio, thus making it harder for developers to build responsive audio apps and user experiences. This talk uncovers those dark secrets while also giving a quick rundown on working with Native code along with Kotlin and how the platform has evolved over time to fix the issues with Low Latency Audio. Towards the end, Oboe library for building real-time audio apps is introduced showcasing how it simplifies everything.
