{{< icon "location-marker" >}} GDG London: Jetpack Compose, Online

<!--more-->

## Abstract

Since the time Android has existed, our workflow for designing a UI has been confined to XML. This has led to other issues and hacks to make UI work as per current times. But that is now about to end. With the introduction of Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit that is based on the declarative programming model you can simply describe what your UI should look like, and Compose takes care of the rest.

In this session, you will understand what exactly is this Jetpack Compose and witness a speed run of developing an app in 30 mins.
