In this series of posts, we'll delve into the world of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs). We'll explore the possibilities of running these models entirely offline, on your own machine, without relying on cloud services or proprietary platforms. You'll learn how to:

- Install and configure an offline GPT model for local use
- Understand the implications of running LLMs on your personal device
- Discover new ways to harness AI power while preserving your online anonymity

Join me as we embark on this exciting journey, where you'll be empowered to take control of your data and make informed choices about how you interact with AI. Let's create a more transparent and secure future for personal AI!
