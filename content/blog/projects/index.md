As a Software Engineer, I've had the privilege of working on various projects that have helped shape my skills and interests. In this series of blog posts, I'll be taking you behind the scenes to explore some of these projects, share updates, and provide insights into what goes on when building and maintaining open-source software.

<!--more-->

From announcing new project launches to sharing incremental updates, feature introductions, and even license changes, I'll give you a front-row seat to my development process. You'll see:

- How I approach updating project licenses and why it matters
- The process of introducing new features and technologies to existing projects
- My thoughts on improving accessibility and performance in open-source software

And more!

I believe that sharing the "how" behind building projects is just as important as showcasing the finished product. In these posts, I'll aim to provide valuable lessons, tips, and perspectives on project development, maintenance, and community engagement.

Join me on this journey as we explore my projects together!
