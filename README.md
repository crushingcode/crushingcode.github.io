# Amplify for Jekyll

*A Jekyll html theme in the vague style of Medium.com built using Google AMP*

Google's [Accelerated Mobile Pages Project](https://www.ampproject.org/)
(a.k.a. "Google AMP" or Google ⚡) is an open-source project that defines rules
for creating websites that load nearly instantly even on mobile devices with
slow connections.

## Getting Started

To use this theme, it's just like using any other Jekyll template:

*Step 1:* [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

*On windows*
If on windows you will need the ruby devkit available here: [rubyinstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/).

*Step 2:* Clone this repo to your computer

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ageitgey/amplify.git
```

*Step 3:* Run `gem install bundler; bundle install` inside the new `/amplify/` folder that was
just created to install the required ruby dependencies.

*Step 4:* Tweak `_config.yml`.

Just fill in everything in the `# Site settings` section.
You'll want to set your site's title, your name, your twitter username, etc.

*Step 5:* Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and then open
[http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) to see your site!

*Step 6:* Publish your site
[just like any other Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/).
