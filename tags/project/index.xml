      <description>I am pretty sure you would agree to the fact that the usual javadoc is not a something everyone likes. The colors are what makes it superrrrrrr boring. Yeah , I actually despise those weird colors and the fact that its been around for so long , made me think how to solve this. Also if you try looking it up on the internet there aren&amp;rsquo;t any solutions that basically solved this in a programmatic way.</description>
