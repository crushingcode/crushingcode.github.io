      <description>It all starts when some android developer tries to figure out a solution to a problem he/she is having while building their &amp;ldquo;Awesome Android App&amp;rdquo;. During the process, most developers would encounter a couple of issues and in tandem, to those, they would come up with possible solutions.
Now here is a thing, if you are like me, who believes that if the problem was big enough for me to spend some time on it and there wasnâ€™t an existing solution out there, I would abstract the whole solution in a modular manner, which eventually turns out to be an android library.</description>

      <description>While working on various projects, there have been times when I have had to implement various gesture-based events. Every time I have had to do that I had to write the whole code for getting the SensorManager and getting access to the SensorEvent, plus the extra logic to detect the gesture. At first, it was just fine to do that since I was a beginner around that time. Then soon I got weary of the whole boilerplate.</description>
