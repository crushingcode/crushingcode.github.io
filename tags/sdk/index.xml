        <description>Lifecycle events in Android.
It has been a pain point for Android developers all over the world. It is no brainer that, most of the times the main cause of a memory leak in the codebase is because an invalid state is accessed which is out of sync with the lifecycle of the activity/fragment of the app.</description>

        <description>It all starts when some android developer tries to figure out a solution to a problem he/she is having while building their &amp;ldquo;Awesome Android App&amp;rdquo;.

        <description>Developers are a different kind of people altogether. They tend to be lazy but strive to be super efficient at the same time.

        <description>Have you ever thought how the central repository works like Maven Central or JCenter?
